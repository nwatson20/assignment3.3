	<h1>The <em>coolest</em> sea creatures on the block</h1>
	<p>The ocean is filled with some of the strangest, most magical creatures you could possibly imagine.</p>
	<h2>Here are some of my favorite sea creatures:</h2>
	
	<h3 class="name">Blue-Ringed Octopus, genus <i>Hapalochlaena</i></h3>
	<p>Octopuses are some of the most emotionally intelligent creatures in the sea. This species is highly <b title="Don't confuse this with poisonous!">venomous</b>, which makes them dangerous to humans despite their small size and docile nature.</p>

	<p style="text-decoration:underline;">Very beautiful, very powerful.</p>
	
	<h3 class="name">Sea Sponge, phylum <i>Porifera</i></h3>
	<p>Sponges are one of the most curious life forms on Earth. They're extremely <b title="It has existed since the beginning of time.">primordial</b>, but have unique and complex inner mechanisms. They don't have true tissue or organ structures, which sets them apart from most animals.</p>

	<p>These creepy-crawly creatures are deep-sea <b title="They eat deceased matter.">scavengers</b> that look like some kind of aquatic pill bug, to which they are related.</p>
